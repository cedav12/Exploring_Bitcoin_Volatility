## Abstract:

This study investigates Bitcoin volatility and its drivers between the years 2020 and 2023. We developed a simple regression model of the volatility (estimated by Garman-Klass estimator), which was further estimated using an IV (Instrumental Variable) approach, due to the assumptions of endogeneity of price. We discover a positive link between Bitcoin volatility and traded volume in \$USD and another robust association is identified with Google searches for the keyword "bitcoin". Our findings emphasize the significance of public interest and its proxies as primary factors driving Bitcoin volatility. This research contributes to literature into the complex dynamics shaping Bitcoin's volatility, while using the most up-to-date data.
